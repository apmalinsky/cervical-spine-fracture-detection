## Project Intro
This project applies deep learning and computer vision methods to automate the detection of cervical spine fractures in CT scan images. Cervical fractures can be subtle and difficult to diagnose consistently, and missed injuries may result in paralysis, chronic pain, or long-term neurological complications.

The goal is to develop, evaluate, and compare multiple model architectures, including a baseline CNN classifier, Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and DETR, to determine their effectiveness in identifying fracture presence and localizing fractures with bounding boxes. This work contributes towards AI-assisted diagnostic tools that may improve speed, consistency, and clinical workflow efficiency in medical imaging.

## Project Description
This project uses a curated subset of the RSNA 2022 Cervical Spine Fracture Detection dataset. The dataset consists of 28,868 CT scan slices, each labeled as fractured or non-fractured, with bounding boxes provided for fractured slices.

### Data Setup
* Navigate to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and click "+ Create" on the left-hand side, then select "Notebook".
* There, you can import [**Notebook 00**](00_CreatePrivateDataset.ipynb) to get started.
* This notebook will walk you through step-by-step to create your own private Kaggle dataset.

### Data Preprocessing
* Images resized to 256x256 and normalized to [0, 1]
* Undersampling applied to mitigate severe class imbalance (target ratio 1:3 positive to negative)
* Stratified group shuffle split ensures all slices from a patient remain in a single dataset partition.
* Verified image dimensions, class distribution, bounding-box consistency, and pixel normalization EDA
* Check our [**Exploratory Data Analysis**](01_ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb)

### Models Implemented
* [**Simple CNN Baseline**](02_SimpleCNN.ipynb): Binary classifier to establish foundational performance
* [**Faster R-CNN**](04_Faster_R_CNN.ipynb): Two-stage detector with ResNet-50 + FPN backbone; designed for small-object medical detection tasks
* [**DETR (Detection Transformer)**](03_DETR.ipynb): Transformer-based detection model fine-tuned with frozen early backbone layers for stability

Each model was trained, validated, and tested on the same curated dataset, with steps including threshold tuning, early stopping, and bounding-box visualization.

### Challenges Addressed
* High class imbalance
* Subtle fracture features requiring high model sensitivity
* Bounding-box formatting alignment for Faster R-CNN
* Overfitting in high-capacity models like DETR
* Need for clinically meaningful detection (localization, not just classification)
